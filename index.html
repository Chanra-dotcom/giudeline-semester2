        <h1>Mozilla Thunderbird 31.0 Quick Start Guide Recently</h1>
        <p>
          we have been hearing many more reports of people having various issues
          configuring and setting up their email accounts using varying range of
          email clients. This guide will be the one of a series of guides which
          aims to help you through the process of configuring your email client
          to receive emails from your email account. Additionally, it will also
          show you additional useful settings and features which may help
          enhance your experience when using these email clients. <br /><br />
          Today, we will be looking at my personal favourite email client,
          Mozilla Thunderbird. The version which I will be using in this guide
          is version 31.0. The steps in this guide may be similar to older
          versions of Thunderbird however, I cannot guarantee that they will be
          the same.<br /><br />
          <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bolder">
            This guide is aimed at users wishing to configure their email client
            quickly.If you wish to view an advanced user setup guide, please

          Upon loading Thunderbird, you will be presented with your local folder
          list. In this menu, you will be able to add your email account to the
          email client.

          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          <strong>Automatic Email Account Setup</strong><br />
          To add your email account to the email client, go to the Local Folders
          tab which should be displayed by the email client. Select the Create a
          new account section and press the email button. Press the button at
          the bottom of the window marked Skip this and use my existing mail to
          add our existing account to the email client.

        <p>
          This will now bring up a window whereby we can enter our email account
          settings. There are several fields which you are required to complete
          in order to connect to your email account:

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Password:</strong>
            This should be the password you would use to log in to your email
            account.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Press the continue button to continue.</p>

          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          The email server and account details are listed in this window. Verify
          that these details are correct for your email server and if so, press
          the Done button.

        <h3><strong>Manual Email Account Setup</strong></h3>
        <p>
          If you wish to manually connect to your email account from the
          Thunderbird client, you must first attempt to connect to it
          automatically. Please refer to the Automatic Email Account Setup
          section for steps to do this. Once you reach the final screen in the
          automatic setup, press the Manual config button at the bottom of the
          window.
        </p>
        <img

          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          Here you can change all of the email server settings which were
          imported automatically by Thunderbird. Once you have entered the
          correct email server and account details, press the Done button. In
          this window, there are more fields which need to be completed in order
          to manually connect to your email account.
